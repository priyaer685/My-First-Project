# 🌾 Smart Agriculture System  

This project automates irrigation and monitors environmental conditions like temperature and soil moisture using sensors and a microcontroller.  
The system sends data to the **Processing IDE** for real-time visualization on a computer screen.  


## 📘 Overview
The system helps farmers by automatically controlling water flow and displaying temperature and moisture readings on the Processing IDE interface.  
It reduces manual effort and ensures efficient water usage.  


## ⚙️ Components Used
- Arduino Uno  
- DHT11 Temperature Sensor  
- Soil Moisture Sensor  
- Water Pump (controlled via Relay Module)  
- Power Supply Module  
- Processing IDE (for visualization)  

## 💡 Working Principle
1. The **DHT11** measures the ambient temperature.  
2. The **soil moisture sensor** detects soil dryness.  
3. When the soil becomes dry, the Arduino activates the **relay**, turning on the **water pump** to irrigate plants.  
4. All sensor data (temperature, humidity, and soil moisture levels) are sent to the **Processing IDE**, where they are displayed graphically.  

## 🧠 Skills & Tools
